# force9.org BBS Homepage

The homepage of an old-school BBS called force9. Originally set up in the 90s with the name "Evolution", it ran on a DEC Intel i386 25mHz,
with 1mb of RAM, a 320mb HD and a 56.6k US Robotics modem!

force9.org is a reincarnation of Evolution housed entirely on a Raspberry Pi, and unsurprisingly, is more powerful, has more memory and a lot
more storage!

Come and have a poke around, you can find us at http://bbs.force9.org.
